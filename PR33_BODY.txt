Refactor to extract helpers and simplify `src/commands/start.ts`.

Summary:
- Extracted helpers: `probeAndPersistSpyderPort`, `resolveOrMergedRunCmd`, `resolvePackagePathForModule`, `startRunnable`.
- Simplified `startModule` and delegated responsibilities to helpers for clarity.
- CI/test updates: use `QFLUSH_TEST_TOKEN` and `QFLUSH_SPYDER_ADMIN_PORT` secrets; tests added for spyder admin port behavior.

Local verification: tests pass locally (25 files, 51 tests).

Checklist:
- [x] Code compiles and tests pass locally
- [x] New helpers covered by tests where relevant
- [ ] Address linter/warn issues (e.g. vite/esbuild warnings)

Notes: please add repository secrets `QFLUSH_TEST_TOKEN` and `QFLUSH_SPYDER_ADMIN_PORT` in GitHub Actions secrets if you want CI to run with stable values.
