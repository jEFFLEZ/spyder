QFLUSH — The Funesterie Runtime System

One-line pitch: "QFLUSH orchestrates your micro-runtimes, proxies and local tools with a lightweight, opinionated index and routing layer (Rome, NPZ, OC8)."

Short blurb:
QFLUSH is a developer-focused runtime orchestrator designed to connect structured modules (Rome) with unstructured projects (the Cambrousse). It provides an index/tag system, a small daemon for checksum and admin APIs, a CLI and a VS Code extension for tight integration.
